# Bunny Search App

This is the copy of the source code of the “Bunny Search” app.

The only difference of this copy with the original is that it uses local database read from a json
file, instead of Firebase. The code used in the original copy can be found by searching the comment
“Used in real app”.

## AI insights with Gemini

The app uses [Google AI Dart SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/google_generative_ai) for generating AI insights in the following features:

1) **Brand Details** - generates AI insights about an existing brand cruelty-free status in [`BrandDetailsPage`](https://github.com/darjaorlova/bunny-search-source-code/blob/gemini/lib/brand/widget/brand_details_page.dart)
2) **Search by Text** - generates AI insights about the brand cruelty-free status based on the query in search if such a brand exists in [`AITextSearchInsightsPage`](https://github.com/darjaorlova/bunny-search-source-code/blob/gemini/lib/home/widget/ai_text_search_insights_page.dart)
3) **Search by Photo** - generates AI insights about the brand cruelty-free status based on the photo in [`AIPhotoSearchInsightsPage`](https://github.com/darjaorlova/bunny-search-source-code/blob/gemini/lib/home/widget/ai_photo_search_insights_page.dart)

Disclaimer: The AI insights are generated by the Google AI Dart SDK and are not factual. This feature is currently for education purposes only.
