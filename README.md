# Bunny Search App

## 🚧 README is work in progress 🚧

This is the copy of the source code of the “Bunny Search” app.

The only difference of this copy with the original is that it uses local database read from a json
file, instead of Firebase. The code used in the original copy can be found by searching the comment
“Used in real app”.

More details on architecture, approaches, functionality, etc., are coming.

You can reach out to me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dariadroid) if you have any questions.
